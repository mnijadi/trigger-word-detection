# Dates Translation

## Description

Trigger Word Detection is a very common task in deep learning, we can see it's use cases in systems like Siri or Alexa. In this project we will build a model that can detect the word "activate" in a 10 second long audio clip. Before building the model, we'll also try to see how we can synthesize a dataset that we could use for training such a model.
